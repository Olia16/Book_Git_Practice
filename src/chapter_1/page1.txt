Hello, this is my first text file with Git.

Hello world

Git is a version control system/tool/software
Repository - is a folder that keeps track of changes

   Local repo vs remote repo
Local repo - is on your computer - hidden git folder
Remote repo - is in [Github.com(http:/github.com)]

- for every project we have separate repository

flow:
Create new project
Create a new package called chapter_1
Create a new text file called page1
